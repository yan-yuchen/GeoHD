## What is GeoHD? 
GeoHD is a Python toolkit for geospatial hotspot detection, visualization, and analysis using urban data. Density-based hotspot detection is an important theory and method in urban research, which realizes the extraction of local research hotspots by combining density analysis and raster algebra. It has been widely used in different fields such as transportation, culture, climate, ecology and so on:

* Transportation ([Yan, Yuchen, et al. (2024)](https://doi.org/10.1111/tgis.13137))
* Housing Submarkets ([Liu, Xinrui, et al.  (2021)](https://doi.org/10.1155/2022/2948352))
* Culture ([Zhang, Haiping, et al.  (2021)](https://doi.org/10.1111/tgis.12682))
* Ecology ([Qian, Chunhua, et al.  (2021)](https://doi.org/10.1177/15501477211039137))

The main functions of GeoHD are fast visualization and hotspot detection based on geospatial point data, and it realizes fixed-bandwidth hotspot detection with adjustable parameters and adaptive-bandwidth hotspot detection. In addition, GeoHD provides spatial point pattern distribution analysis such as Ripley G-function calculation and fast comparison image drawing.

## Getting Started

### Install with pip

The package is available in PyPi and requires [Python 3.11](https://www.python.org/downloads/) or higher. It can be installed using:

```bash
$ pip install GeoHD
```

### Usage

Visualization of hotspots on real maps:

```python
visualize_shapefile('data.shp', output_image_path='custom_image.png')
```

</p>


Analytic Plane Point Patterns: Ripley G, Ripley F, Ripley J, Ripley K, Ripley L, etc. through the plotting function.

```python
plot_g_function('data.shp')
```

</p>

The study area was divided into a quadrilateral (hexagonal) grid and fast visualization was achieved based on the density of point data within the divided area.

```python
create_cell_zones(area_file, crash_file)
create_hex_grid_zones(area_file, crash_file)
create_cell_heatmap(area_file, crash_file)
create_hexagonal_heatmap(area_file, crash_file)
```

<p align="center">
  <img src="./doc/3.png" width="400" height="300"/>
  <img src="./doc/4.png" width="400" height="300"/>
</p>

<p align="center">
  <img src="./doc/5.png" width="400" height="300"/>
  <img src="./doc/6.png" width="400" height="300"/>
</p>

Realization of kernel density analysis with fixed bandwidth:

```python
density_raster = process_shapefile(input_file_path)
plot_density_raster(density_raster,output_data_path, *gpd.read_file(input_file_path).total_bounds)
```

Kernel density analysis for realizing adaptive bandwidth:

```python
adaptiveKDE(shp_file,output_data_path)
```

<p align="center">
  <img src="./doc/8.png" width="400" height="300"/>
</p>


Hotspot Identification:

```python
hotspots = extract_hotspots(density_data_path)
visualize_hotspots(np.load(density_data_path), hotspots)
```
